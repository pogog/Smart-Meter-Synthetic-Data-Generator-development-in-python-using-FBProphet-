# Synthetic-data-generator
Data-science is a key component of Morden science since it fuels AI, data analytics, etc. As the electrical grid has been modernized into a smart grid, it has also become increasingly dependent on data science to monitor and control grid activity. Realistic data is essential to evaluating the algorithm's workability but it is difficult to obtain real smart meter data due to strict privacy and security policies of many countries. using the prophet library, we code and develop a prediction-based Synthetic Data Generator GUI, which generate the synthetic data sets.

# Setup, Configure, and Build

step 1- In order to run this data first extract unzip the source file which contain original data set of consumers energy savings in to folder where python environment running
Step 2- Run main.py script, it open GUI interface and asking for number of meters (n) and number of days. Enter the credential and submit it.
Step 3- Based on the entered credential it will generate the CSV files with predicted output for energy consumption.
Step 4- Two output file will be generated A) PredictedOutput_n.csv B) PredictedallOutput_n.csv which contain all the necessary details generated by FBprophet library.
