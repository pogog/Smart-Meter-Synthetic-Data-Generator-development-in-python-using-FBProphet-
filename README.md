# synthetic-data-generator
Data-science is a key component of morden science since it fuels AI, data analytics, etc. As the electrical grid has been modernized into a smart grid, it has also become increasingly dependent on data science to monitor and control grid activity. Realistic data is essential to evaluating the algorithm's workability but it is difficult to obtain real smart meter data due to strict privacy and security policies of many countries. using the prophet library, we code and develop a prediction-based Synthetic Data Generator GUI, which generate the synthetic data sets.
